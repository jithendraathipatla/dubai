            <br />
            Offshore company formation in Ajman was allowed only as late as
            2014. The Ajman Free Zone Authority offers benefits such as zero
            taxation, complete privacy and 100% repatriation on profit to
            offshore companies in Ajman Free Zone. The cost to set up an
            offshore company in Ajman is the cheapest in UAE and the time taken
            to establish it is the least. Ajman offshore companies are
            non-resident companies and are not issued operating licenses. Here,
            these companies will only get a company incorporation certificate.
            No Ajman offshore company can conduct business within United Arab
            Emirates. These shareholders are, however, allowed to invest in UAE
            companies. However, for Ajman offshore company registration, a
            director of shareholder needs to be physically present in Ajman Free
            Zone office, along with a registered agent, and personally sign the
            documents.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unlike other Emirates, minimum two directors are needed for Ajman
            offshore company registration. To setup offshore companies in this
            region it is required to perform annual audits and physically hold
            meetings in the presence of an auditor. It is mandatory to have a
            registered agent for any interaction with Ajman Authority in
            relation to Ajman offshore company formation . Thatâ€™s where Shuraa
