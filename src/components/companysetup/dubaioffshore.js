            A tax haven like no other is what UAE offshore businesses enjoy. A
            lot of countries provide tax benefits and are known to protect the
            assets and financial information of high net-worth individuals.
            However, Dubai offshore has emerged as the best and most secure tax
            haven for company incorporation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dubai offshores are one of the few tax havens that has not signed
            any treaties to disclose financial information of offshore clients
            to home countries of these individuals. Dubai offshore regulator
            does not keep a public register of shareholders and directors and
            can never be forced to reveal your company information to other
            countries or tax authorities. When you register an offshore company
            in Dubai, you are a legal bona fide business, which gives you an
            easy access to conducting business in the Middle East, anywhere
            outside UAE.
