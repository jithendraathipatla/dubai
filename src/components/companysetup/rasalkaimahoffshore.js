            The RAK Investment Authority launched the offshore company concept
            in 2007 and allowed offshore company registration in Ras al Khaimah.
            The RAK Offshore Registry in the Ras Al-Khaimah free zone gives more
            flexibility than other offshore company jurisdictions in the UAE. It
            allows international companies to own free-hold properties anywhere
            in the UAE and there are no restrictions on the different types of
            offshore businesses that can be set up here. Companies flock to set
            up an offshore company in Ras al Khaimah because it is more
            economical than Setting up a JAFZA offshore company . RAK offshore
            companies do not have offices in UAE, they are only registered here.
            The RAK offshore company regulator issues an operating license to
            these companies. As these companies do not get a business license,
            they cannot conduct any business in UAE. No taxes and full access to
            company profits, in addition to complete privacy, makes company
            formation in Ras al Khaimah free zones an attractive option. You
            need to have an agent registered with the RAK free zone authorities
            for any work related to RAK offshore company formation. The agent’s
            office becomes the registered office space of the RAK offshore
            company.
