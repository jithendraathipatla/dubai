            Planning on company registration in Dubai freezone? Dubai offers
            more than 20 freezones and has some of the most prestigious
            freezones in the UAE. Dubai freezones offer world-class business
            amenities, options such as flexi-desk and flexi-office setups, great
            infrastructure, access to freehold property and complete privacy to
            investors with limited reporting obligations. While Dubai free zone
            business setup allows you to enjoy all the benefits of no taxation
            and import duty exemptions that mainland Dubai companies enjoy, it
            also gives you the benefit of 100% ownership over your company.
            However, with freezone business setup in Dubai you can do business
            internationally and not within the country. In case you want to
            conduct business within UAE, you can simply partner with a local
            distributor and you will be free to trade within UAE as well, speak
            to a consult for free to know your options.
